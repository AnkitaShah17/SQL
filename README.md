In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of sales and profit data using SQL. The dataset includes detailed information on orders, products, customers, and returns. The key objectives of the analysis were to identify top-performing products, analyze profit trends, and understand the impact of returns on overall sales.

Key Analyses:

Identified the top 10 products by sales.
Calculated the highest profit by product, category, and customer.

Delivery Performance:
Analyzed the difference in delivery days for the highest sales products.

Yearly and Monthly Trends:
Summarized total sales, profit, and quantity sold each year and month.

Regional and Category Analysis:
Evaluated total sales, profit, and quantity by region and category.
Identified cities and categories with the highest and lowest profits.
Distinct Values and Data Cleaning:
Counted distinct customer names, cities, and categories.
Cleaned return reasons for consistency.

Return Analysis:
Analyzed sales and profit for returned orders.
Evaluated the impact of different return reasons on profit.
Profit/Loss Categorization:
Categorized orders into profit/loss buckets for better financial insights.
Country-wise Sales and Profit:
Summarized sales and profit by country based on order IDs.
